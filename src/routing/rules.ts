 * Evaluates one rule and, if it applies, executes it.

 * path appends exactly one {@linkcode ActionResult} to the context's audit trail — including the
 * paths that do nothing — because that trail is the only account of the run that survives into
 * production, where the function emits no logs.
 *
 * A filter that throws is treated as not matching rather than as a failure of the whole run. One
 * malformed expression in a datatable should not take the rule set with it, and the parse error is
 * preserved on the result so it is still visible.
 *
 * @param context - The routing context as the preceding rules left it.
 * @param rule - The rule to evaluate.
 * @returns The updated context, and the result appended to its audit trail.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import type { RoutingContext, Rule } from "../types/mod.ts";
 * import { handleRule } from "./rules.ts";
 *
 * declare const context: RoutingContext;
 * declare const rule: Rule;
 *
 * const { context: updated, result } = await handleRule(context, rule);
