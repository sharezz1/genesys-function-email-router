 * One entry point rather than a sequence you have to remember: it works out which of the pieces
 * already exist — integration, data action, runtime — and fills in the gaps. On a fresh checkout
 * that means walking you through creating everything; on a configured repo it goes straight to
 * uploading and publishing.
 *
 * Interactive only when attached to a terminal. Under CI there are no prompts: anything missing is
 * reported as the variable or config key to set, and the run fails rather than waiting on input.
 *
 * Usage: `deno run -A scripts/publish.ts`, or `make publish`. Takes no arguments.
 *
 * The Cliffy import is a direct specifier rather than an entry in `deno.json` `imports`, which is
 * why this file disables `no-import-prefix`. That map is the function's dependency surface, and a
 * prompt library has no business being reachable from `src/`. The rule exists to stop unpinned
 * dependencies creeping in, and that concern is covered here: the specifier is version-ranged and
 * `deno.lock` records it, so `deno install --frozen` still verifies it like any other dependency.
